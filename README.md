### Project Description
[Photo to Punchline" is a fun web app where users upload a photo, which is then cartoonized using Gemini AI. The app detects the user's facial expression and overlays a matching Malayalam *pazhamcholl* (proverb) or comedy dialogue onto the image, creating a personalized and humorous¬†visual¬†output."Photo to Punchline" is a fun web app where users upload a photo, which is then cartoonized using Gemini AI.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[A web app that cartoonizes your photo, detects your mood, and overlays the perfect pazhamcholl or Malayalam punchline. Why? Because your face deserves a comeback line]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[‚ÄúPhoto to Punchline‚Äù is a fun, useless-but-entertaining web app where:

Users upload a photo.

The app cartoonizes it using Gemini AI.

Facial expressions are analyzed to determine mood (happy, angry, confused, etc.).

A matching Malayalam pazhamchollu (proverb) or comedy dialogue is added.

The final output is a personalized, humorous, shareable meme-like image.]
